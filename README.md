# Statistical Analysis on Online Purchasing Habits
The purpose of this analysis was to identify how online purchasing habits vary between men and women.
A questionnaire was desinged and distributed among a set of individuals. These individuals were chosen to be those in the age range 20 - 40 and who has access to either a laptop or a mobile device.

The collected samples contained 58 men and 52 women.
They were questioned about the online purchases they have done within the last 6 months.
These samples were then used for testing some of the hypothesis we had about online purchasing habits.

The 'Scripts' folder contains the scripts we used for the analysis. They are written in r and you can simply run them through RStudio.

proportion_compariosn.r:

This script is used to test whether men are more likely to do online purchases rather than women. A randomization distribution is constructed and the p-value is calculated using that.

mean_noofpurchases_comparision.r:

This script is used to test whether average number of purchases men make are higher than the average number of purchases women make.

Additionally, we did a descriptive analysis using r to gain more insights.
